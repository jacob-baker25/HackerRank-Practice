Goal: Given a time in -hour AM/PM format, convert it to military (24-hour) time.

Approach: This code converts a 12-hour format time string to a 24-hour format time string by first parsing the input 
          string into a datetime object using a specific format and then reformatting that datetime object into the desired 24-hour string.

Time Complexity: O(1)
Space Complexity: O(1)
